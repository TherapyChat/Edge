## Overview
Edge is a lightweight network abstraction layer. 
We designed Edge to be simple to use and also very flexible. We oriented this framework to make API REST requests. We have added some useful features like Authentication, Network activity indicator, and custom logging with `Interceptors`. This network layer queues all requests to avoid making redundant network requests. Also, when the user loses the connection, the requests are queued and are paused until the user recovers the network connection.

## Features
- Generic, protocol-based task implementation
- Eliminates redundant network requests
- Enqueue requests when user lost connection
- Singleton free
- Super friendly API
- Stop and go engine
- No external dependencies
- Robust `Interceptor` system
- Minimal implementation
- Support for `iOS/macOS/tvOS/watchOS/Linux`
- Support for CocoaPods/Carthage/Swift Package Manager

## Getting Started

This is a tiny example to build and execute a network request with `Edge`.

```swift
enum Foo {
    case bar
}

extension Foo: Task {
    var path: String {
        return "get"
    }
}

let client = Edge(with "https://httpbin.org")

client.request(Foo.bar) { (result: JSONResponse) in
    switch result {
    case .success(let JSON):
        print(JSON)
    case .failure(let error):
        print(error)
    }
}
```

## Interceptors

### Authentication

You can authenticate all requests with `Authorization`. 

```swift 

let jwt = Authorization(scheme: .Bearer, token: "1")

client.add(interceptor: jwt)

```

### Network Activity Indicator

You can show on status bar the network activity indicator with `Activity`.

```swift

let networkActivity = Activity()

client.add(interceptor: networkActivity)

```

### Custom Logger 

You can simple build a network interceptor to log all requests.

```swift

struct Logger: Interceptor {

    func willExecute(request: Request) {
        print(request)
    }

    func process(response: Response) {
        print(response)
    }

}

client.add(interceptor: Logger())
```

```swift
github 'therapychat/Edge'
```

### Swift Package Manager

You can use [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) and specify dependency in `Package.swift` by adding this:
```
.Package(url: "https://github.com/therapychat/Edge.git", majorVersion: 0)
```
